    While attending the University of Manitoba, I set myself on the toughest journey to find myself and Computer Science was everything to
    me. I learnt more than just coding. Through the help of our beloved professors, I found myself shifting my mindset to think of the
    world more critically and logically. I also fell in love with the community of fellow classmates and took part in many social events
    that expands my reach and network.
